- Show list of people
- Using EditPerson.html as a starting point convert this to an MVC view
- Make the new Edit view save the person to the person table
- Add functionality to add an address to a person and save to database
- Using JQuery mirror the email input value into a DIV on the Edit view
- Validate last name and email address
- Implement an Interface to support IDeleted
- Implement functionality to delete a user, this should be a soft delete.
- Treat this as an enterprise application, implement any supporting classes, projects etc. as needed to show best practices
